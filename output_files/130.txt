class,
which,
of
course,
also
becomes
the
owning
class.
Neither
does
parliamentarism
(democracy,
republic)
appear
to
be
a
good
means
since
it
too
substitutes
the
will
of
a
few
for
that
of
all,
and
if
on
the
one
hand
it
allows
a
little
more
freedom
than
dictatorship,
on
the
other
it
creates
greater
illusions,
and
in
the
name
of
a
fictitious
collective
interest,
rides
roughshod
over
every
real
interest,
and
by
means
of
elections
and
the
vote,
disregards
the
wishes
of
each
and
everyone.
There
remains
free
organization,
from
below
upwards,
from
the
simple
to
the
complex,
through
free
agreement
