This
dramatic
series
of
terrorist
acts
established
the
image
of
the
anarchist
as
a
mindless
destroyer,
an
image
that
was
further
strengthened
as
anarchist
attacks
on
government
officials,
as
well
as
on
restaurants
and
other
public
places,
became
more
widespread.
During
the
1890s,
especially
in
France,
anarchism
was
adopted
as
a
philosophy
by
many
avant-garde
artistic
and
literary
figures,
including
the
painters
Gustave
Courbet
(who
had
been
a
disciple
of
Proudhon),
Camille
Pissarro,
Georges
Seurat,
and
Paul
Signac
and
