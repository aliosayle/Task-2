its
emphasis
on
spontaneity,
theoretical
flexibility,
simplicity
of
life,
and
the
importance
of
love
and
anger
as
complementary
and
necessary
components
in
both
social
and
individual
action—attracted
those
who
opposed
impersonal
political
institutions
and
the
calculations
of

The
anarchist
rejection
of
the
state,
and
the
insistence
on
decentralism
and
local
autonomy,
found
strong
echoes
among
those
who
advocated
participatory
democracy.
The
anarchist
insistence
on
direct
action
was
reflected
in
calls
for
extraparliamentary
action
and
violent
confrontation
by
some
student
groups
in
France,
the
United
States,
and
Japan.
And
the
recurrence
of
the
theme
of
workers’
control
