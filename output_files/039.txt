anarchists
that
“the
insurrectionary
deed
destined
to
affirm
socialist
principles
by
acts,
is
the
most
efficacious
means
of
propaganda.”
The
first
acts
were
rural
insurrections
intended
to
arouse
the
illiterate
masses
of
the
Italian
countryside.
After
the
insurrections
failed,
anarchist
activism
tended
to
take
the
form
of
acts
of
terrorism
by
individual
protesters,
who
would
attempt
to
kill
ruling
figures
to
make
the
state
appear
vulnerable
and
to
inspire
the
masses
with
their
self-sacrifice.
Between
1890
and
1901
several
such
symbolic
murders
were
carried
out;
the
victims
included
King
Umberto
I
of
Italy,
the
empress
consort
Elizabeth
of
Austria,
President
