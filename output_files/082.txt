and
early
1920s.
Led
by
the
generation
of
intellectuals
sent
to
study
abroad,
the
movement
was
critical
of
all
aspects
of
traditional
Chinese
culture
and
ethics
and
called
for
sweeping
reforms
in
existing
political
and
social
institutions.
Anarchists
were
also
active
in
South
China.
In
Canton,
a
native
school
of
anarchism
emerged
around
the
charismatic
revolutionary
Liu
Shifu,
better
known
by
his
adopted
name
Shifu.
In
1912
Shifu
founded
the
Cock-Crow
Society,
whose
journal,
Peopleâ€™s
Voice,
was
the
leading
organ
of
Chinese
anarchism
in
the
1910s.
Although
not
a
particularly
original
thinker,
Shifu
was
a
skilled
expositor
of
anarchist
doctrine.
