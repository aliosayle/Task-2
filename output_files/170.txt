produce
of
human
labor
in
a
gorgeous
and
vain
luxury,
and
the
pauper
reduced
to
a
miserable
and
insecure
existence,
is
thus
growing
wider
and
wider,
so
as
to
break
the
very
unity
of
society--the
harmony
of
its
life--and
to
endanger
the
progress
of
its
further
development.
At
the
same
time,
workingmen
are
less
and
less
inclined
to
patiently
endure
this
division
of
society
into
two
classes,
as
they
themselves
become
more
and
more
conscious
of
the
wealth-producing
power
of
modern
industry,
of
the
part
played
by
labor
in
the
production
of
wealth,
and
of
their
own
capacities
of
organization.
