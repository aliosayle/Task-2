successful
in
Spain;
for
a
long
period
the
anarchist
movement
in
that
country
remained
the
most
numerous
and
the
most
powerful
in
the
world.
The
first
known
Spanish
anarchist,
Ramón
de
la
Sagra,
a
disciple
of
Proudhon,
founded
the
world’s
first
anarchist
journal,
El
Porvenir,
in
La
Coruña
in
1845,
which
was
quickly
suppressed.
Mutualist
ideas
were
later
publicized
by
Francisco
Pi
y
Margall,
a
federalist
leader
and
the
translator
of
many
of
Proudhon’s
books.
During
the
Spanish
revolution
of
1873,
Pi
y
Margall
attempted
to
establish
a
decentralized,
or
“cantonalist,”
political
system
on
Proudhonian
lines.
