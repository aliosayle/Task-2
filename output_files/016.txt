used
to
express
both
approval
and
disapproval.
In
early
usage
all
these
terms
were
pejorative:
for
example,
during
the
English
Civil
Wars
(1642–51)
the
radical
Levelers,
who
called
for
universal
manhood
suffrage,
were
referred
to
by
their
opponents
as
“Switzerising
anarchists,”
and
during
the
French
Revolution
the
leader
of
the
moderate
Girondin
faction
of
Parliament,
Jacques-Pierre
Brissot,
accused
his
most
extreme
rivals,
the
Enragés,
of
being
the
advocates
of
“anarchy”:
Laws
that
are
not
carried
into
effect,
authorities
without
force
and
despised,
crime
unpunished,
property
attacked,
the
safety
of
the
individual
violated,
the
morality
of
the
people
corrupted,
no
constitution,
