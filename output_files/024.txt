as
far
as
possible,
because,
according
to
Godwin,
they
encourage
a
majoritarian
tyranny
and
dilute
individual
responsibility.
Godwin
also
condemns
“accumulated
property”
as
a
source
of
power
over
others
and
envisions
a
loose
economic
system
in
which
people
would
give
and
take
according
to
their
needs.
Godwin
was
a
prophet
of
technological
progress,
and
he
believed
that
industrial
development
would
eventually
reduce
the
necessary
working
time
to
half
an
hour
a
day,
provided
people
lived
simply,
and
that
this
arrangement
would
facilitate
the
transition
to
a
society
without
authority.
