it
might
be
asked
in
how
far
the
same
capacities
could
bring
out
the
same
results,
if
the
very
same
employer
could
find
no
trustworthy
managers
and
no
skilled
workmen,
and
if
hundreds
of
inventions
were
not
stimulated
by
the
mechanical

of
so
many
inhabitants
of
this
country.
The
anarchists
cannot
consider,
like
the
collectivists,
that
a
remuneration
which
would
be
proportionate
to
the
hours
of
labor
spent
by
each
person
in
the
production
of
riches
may
be
an
ideal,
or
even
an
approach
to
an
ideal,
society.
