creating
an
anarchist
communist
society
so
in
that
sense
it's
not.
I
guess
you
need
to
be
clear
on
which
sense
you're
using
the
term
in
this
article.

you
can
propose
a
better
wording
feel
free
to
post
it

OP
What
distinguishes
anarchist
communism
from
other
variants
of
libertarian
communism
is
the
formers
opposition
to
all
forms
of
political
power,
hierarchy
and
domination.
