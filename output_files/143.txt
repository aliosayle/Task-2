While
historically
many
anarchist
communists
have
been
active
anarcho-syndicalists,
many
are
critical
towards
those
syndicalists
who
seek
some
form
of
self-managed
wage
system
rather
than
its
abolition,
pointing
out
that
any
system
which
maintains
economic
relations
based
on
reward
of
effort
and
exchange
is
not
communist.
Modern
day
anarchist
communists
are
represented
in
several
organisations
within
the
International
of
Anarchist
Federations,
including
the
Anarchist
Federation
(Britain).
Platformist
anarchist
communists

Workers
Solidarity
Movement
(Ireland)
