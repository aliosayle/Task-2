people
long
for
the
bourgeois
regime,
and
to
return
later
(as
will
happen
in
Russia)
to
a
capitalistic
system
as
a
result
of
the
impossibility
of
organizing
a
social
life
which
is
bearable
and
as
a
reaction
of
the
spirit
of
liberty
which
is
not
a
privilege
of
the
“latin
spirit”
as
the
Communist
foolishly
accuses
me
of
saying,
but
a
necessity
of
the
human
spirit
for
action
in
Russia
no
less
than
in
Italy.
However
much
we
detest
the
democratic
lie,
which
in
the
name
of
the
“people”
oppresses
the
people
in
the
interests
of
a
class,
we
detest
