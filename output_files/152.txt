is
not
whether
one
has
a
right
to
his
product,
but
whether
there
is
such
a
thing
as
an
individual
product.
I
have
pointed
out
in
preceding
chapters
that
there
is
no
such
thing
in
modern
industry:
all
labor
and
the
products
of
labor
are
social.
The
argument,
therefore,
about
the
right
of
the
individual
to
his
product
has
no
practical
merit.
