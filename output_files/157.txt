Anarchists'
in
the
'Libertarian
Communist'
camp,
and
not
in
the
AC
camp.
"Opposition
to
all
forms
of
political
power,
hierarchy
and
domination"
can
be
seen
as
similar
to
"opposition
to
all
earthquakes"
-
we
all
'oppose'
them,
but
'ignoring'
their
reality
is
no
basis
for
dealing
with
them.
Pretending
'earthquakes'
or
'power'
are
going
to
go
away
is
a
political
mistake.

LBird's
post
sums
up
the
differences
between
Council
Communism
and
Anarchist
Communism
pretty
well.
It
looked
like
nonsense
to
me.
