starting
point
is
the
'individual'.
These
ACs
also
reject
'political
power'
as
being
a
temporary,
class-based,
state
phenomenon,
whereas
CCs
(and
other
LCs)
see
'power'
to
be
an
eternal
social
phenomenon,
not
an
attribute
of
some
individuals
or
some
societies.
I
really
disagree
with
this,
I
think
being
a
communist
is
the
logical
result
of
looking
at
the
world
from
and
individualist
perspective,
there
is
no
individual
without
society,
and
there
is
no
society
with
out
the
individual.
Any
perspective
that
ignores
one
or
the
other
is
incomplete.
As
far
as
power
goes,
you
seem
to
be
defining
it
differently
