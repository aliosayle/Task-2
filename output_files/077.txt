organizing
workers
for
radical
activities.
He
also
managed
to
persuade
the
newly
founded
Socialist
Party
of
Japan
to
adopt
his
views
on
direct
action.
In
1910
Kotoku
was
among
hundreds
arrested
for
involvement
in
a
conspiracy
to
assassinate
the
Meiji
emperor.
Although
he
had
withdrawn
from
the
conspiracy
before
his
arrest,
Kotoku
was
tried
for
treason
and
was
executed
in
1911.
His
death
marked
the
beginning
of
a
“winter
period”
for
anarchism
in
Japan,
which
was
to
last
until
the
end
of
World
War
I.
Although
much
diminished,
anarchist
activity
in
Japan
did
not
completely
cease
during
this
period.
