well
i
think
self-identification
by
individuals
is
a
pretty
poor
threshold
for
critiquing
traditions
involving
millions
of
workers
over
a
century.
but
the
point
is
that
critique
exists
and
is
part
of
the
reason
for
there
being
separate
anarchist
communist
and
anarcho-syndicalist
organisations
so
it
should
be
in
the
intro.
but
i
don't
think
we
can
present
as
fact
that
"in
general"
anarchist
communists
are
against
anarcho-syndicalism,
since
the
vast
majority
of
anarcho-syndicalists
are
anarchist
communists,
and
those
that
aren't
(being
charitable)
are
the
kind
of
'anarchists'
who
take
state
money
(CGT
etc).
and
as
they're
communists,
they
