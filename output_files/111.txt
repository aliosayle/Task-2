they
have
hardly
ever
been
in
agreement
on
the
means
to
adopt,
or
the
opportunities
that
have
existed
from
time
to
time
to
open
up
the
way
towards
human
emancipation.
But
this
is
only
an
incidental
and
minor
disagreement.
There
have
always
been
socialists
who
have
been
in
a
hurry,
just
as
there
are
also
anarchists
who
want
to
advance
with
leaden
feet,
and
even
some
who
do
not
believe
at
all
in
revolution.
The
important,
fundamental
dissension
is
quite
another:
socialists
are
authoritarians,
anarchists
are
libertarians.
Socialists
want
power,
whether
by
peaceful
means
or
by
force
is
of
no
