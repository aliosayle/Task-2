proportion
as
all
classes
of
the
community
take
a
more
lively
part
in
public

and
knowledge
spreads
among
the
masses,
their
longing
for
equality
becomes
stronger,
and
their
demands

The
worker
claims
his
share

he
claims

but

full
rights
in
the
higher
enjoyments
of
science
and
art.

claims,
which
formerly
were
uttered
only
by
the
social
reformer,
begin
now
to
be
made
