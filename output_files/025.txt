Godwin
enjoyed
great
celebrity
in
the
1790s
and
influenced
varied
writers
such
as
Percy
Bysshe
Shelley
(whose
Queen
Mab
and
Prometheus
Unbound
are
virtually
anarchist
poems),
William
Wordsworth,
William
Hazlitt,
and
Robert
Owen.
By
the
time
of
his
death
in
1836,
however,
he
was
almost
forgotten.
Although
his
ideas
had
a
subterranean
influence
on
the
British
labour
movement
through
the
work
of
Owen,
they
had
virtually
no
effect
on
the
quasi-political
anarchist
movement
on
the
continent
of
Europe
during
the
mid-19th
century.
