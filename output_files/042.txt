with
the
demands—equally
insistent—of
the
individual
who
desires
freedom.
Some
anarchist
thinkers,
such
as
the
German
Max
Stirner,
refused
to
recognize
any
limitation
on
the
rights
of
individuals
to
do
as
they
please
or
any
obligation
to
act
socially,
and
even
those
who
accepted
Kropotkin’s
socially
oriented
doctrines
of
anarchist
communism
have
in
practice
been
reluctant
to
create
forms
of
organization
that
threatened
their
freedom
of
action
or
seemed
likely
to
harden
into
institutions.
In
consequence,
although
a
number
of
international
anarchist
congresses
were
held—the
most
celebrated
being
those
in
London
in
1881
and
Amsterdam
in
1907—no
effective
worldwide
organization
