Anarchism’s
creative
writers
also
produced
significant
works
of
fiction.
Under
the
influence
of
Looking
Backward,
2000–1887
(1888),
the
best-selling

novel
by
the
American
writer
Edward
Bellamy,
many
anarchists
devised
utopias
of
their
own—notably
Lois
Waisbrooker,
whose
A
Sex
Revolution
(1892)
blended
anarchism
and
feminism,
and
J.
William
Lloyd,
whose
The
Natural
Man:
A
Romance
of
the
Golden

(1902)
prefigured
the
counterculture
of
the
1960s.
Largely
owing
to
criticism
by
Kropotkin
and
other
anarchists,
Bellamy’s
Equality
(1897),
the
sequel
to
Looking
Backward,
contained
almost
none
of
the
earlier
story’s
statist
elements.
