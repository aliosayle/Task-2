If
the
iron
trade
and
the
cotton
industry
of
this
country
have
reached
so
high
a
degree
of
development,
they
have
done
so
owing
to
the
parallel
growth
of
thousands
of
other
industries,
great
and
small;
to
the
extension
of
the
railway
system;
to
an
increase
of
knowledge
among
both
the
skilled
engineers
and
the
mass
of
the
workmen;
to
a
certain
training
in
organization
slowly
developed
among
producers;
and,
above
all,
to
the
world-trade
which
has
itself
grown
up,
