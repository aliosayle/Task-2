(Ukraine).
Kropotkin
is
often
seen
as
the
most
important
theorist
of
anarchist
communism,
outlining
his
economic
ideas
in
books
The
Conquest
of
Bread
and
Fields,
Factories
and
Workshops.
Kropotkin
felt
co-operation
to
be
more
beneficial
than
competition,
arguing
in
Mutual
Aid:
A
Factor
of
Evolution
that
this
was
illustrated
in
nature.
Anarchist
communist
ideas
were
very
influential
in
the
introduction
of
anarchism
to
Japan
through
the
efforts
of
Kôtoku
Shûsui
in
the
early
1900s
who
corresponded
with
Kropotkin
and
translated
his
works.
