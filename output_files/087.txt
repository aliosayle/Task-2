formulated
a
doctrine
of
“pure”
anarchism
in
opposition
to
Marxist
influences.
A
period
of
conflict
between
such
pure
and
Marxist-oriented
anarchists
ended
in
the
early
1930s,
when
all
forms
of
radicalism
were
crushed
by
the
military
government.
Although
politically
irrelevant
after
the
early
1920s,
anarchists
in
China
continued
to
work
toward
social
revolution
in
education
and
culture.
The
author
Ba
Jin
wrote
novels
and
short
stories
on
anarchist
themes
that
were
widely
popular
in
China
in
the
1930s
and
’40s,
and
Ba
was
elected
to
important
literary
and
cultural
organizations
after
the
communist
victory
in
the
Chinese
Civil
War
(1945–49).
