consequence
to
them,
and
once
in
office,
wish
to
impose
their
program
on
the
people
by
dictatorial
or
democratic
means.
Anarchists
instead
maintain,
that
government
cannot
be
other
than
harmful,
and
by
its
nature
it
defends
either
an
existing
privileged
class
or
creates
a
new
one;
and
instead
of
aspiring
to
take
the
place
of
the
existing
government
anarchists
seek
to
destroy
every
organism
which
empowers
some
to
impose
their
own
ideas
and
interests
on
others,
for
they
want
to
free
the
way
for
development
towards
better
forms
of
human
fellowship
which
will
emerge
from
experience,
by
everybody
being
free
