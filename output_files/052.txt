however,
the
influence
of
Bakunin
was
stronger.
In
1868
his
Italian
disciple,
Giuseppe
Fanelli,
visited
Barcelona
and
Madrid,
where
he
established
branches
of
the
International.
By
1870
they
had
40,000
members,
and
in
1873
the
movement
numbered
about
60,000,
organized
mainly
in
working
menâ€™s
associations.
In
1874
the
anarchist
movement
in
Spain
was
forced
underground,
a
phenomenon
that
recurred
often
in
subsequent
decades.
Nevertheless,
it
flourished,
and
anarchism
became
the
favoured
type
of
radicalism
among
two
very
different
groups,
the
factory
workers
of
Barcelona
and
other
Catalan
towns
and
the
impoverished
peasants
who
toiled
on
the
estates
of
absentee
owners
