Welcome

rather
than
make
this
into
an
argument
over
CC
vs
AC,
(a
bit
fruitless
imo)
it
is
better
to
focus
on
what
the
actual
differences
are.
I
would
posit
the
main
difference
to
be
ideological
confrontation
of
the
concept
of
'power'
or
'hierarchy'.
The
CCers
have
more
of
a
theoretical
concern
over
rank
and
file
control
of
organizations.
(not
to
say
that
concern
isn't
also
present
in
anarchist
communism,
but
it
exists
in
AC
as
a
derivative
of
anti-hierarchical
ideology)
