off
his
coat
to
give
it
to
the
shivering
pauper,
and
his
mother
will
tell
him
that
he
must
never
understand
moral
principles
in
their
direct
sense.
If
he
lives
according
to
them,
he
will
go
barefoot,
without
alleviating
the
misery
around
him!
Morality
is
good
on
the
lips,
not
in
deeds.
Our
preachers
say,
"Who
works,
prays,"
and
everyone
endeavors
to
make
others
work
for
him.
They
say,
"Never
lie!"
and
politics
are
a
big
lie.
And
we
accustom
ourselves
and
our
children
to
live
under
this
double-faced
morality,
which
is
hypocrisy,
and
to
conciliate
our
double-facedness
by
sophistry.
