mistakenly
claimed
as
ancestors
by
modern
anarchist
writersâ€”the
rejection
of
government
was
merely
one
aspect
of
a
retreat
from
the
material
world
into
a
realm
of
spiritual
grace,
and,
as
part
of
the
search
for
individual
salvation,
it
was
hardly
compatible
with
the
sociopolitical
doctrine
of
anarchism.
In
all
its
forms,
that
doctrine
consists
of
(1)
an
analysis
of
the
power
relations
underlying
existing
forms
of
political
authority
and
(2)
a
vision
of
an
alternative
libertarian
society
based
on
cooperation,
as
opposed
to
competition
and
coercion,
and
functioning
without
the
need
for
government
authority.
