theorists.
Drawing
on
his
own
experience
of
prison
life,
Kropotkin
also
advocated
a
thorough
modification
of
the
penal
system.
Prisons,
he
said,
were
“schools
of
crime”
that,
far
from
reforming
the
offender,
subjected
him
to
brutalizing
punishments
and
hardened
him
in
his
criminal
ways.
In
the
future
anarchist
world,
antisocial
behaviour
would
be
dealt
with
not
by
laws
and
prisons
but
by
human
understanding
and
the
moral
pressure
of
the
community.
Kropotkin
combined
the
qualities
of
a
scientist
and
moralist
with
those
of
a
revolutionary
organizer
and
propagandist.
For
all
his
mild
benevolence,
he
condoned
the
use
of
violence
