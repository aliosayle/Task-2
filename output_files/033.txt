The
second
important
difference
between
Bakunin
and
Proudhon
lay
in
their
concepts
of
revolutionary
method.
Proudhon
believed
it
was
possible
to
create
within
existing
society

mutualist
associations
that
could
replace
it;
he
therefore
opposed
violent
revolutionary
action.
Bakunin,
declaring
that
“the
passion
for
destruction
is
also
a
creative
urge,”
refused
to
accept
a
piecemeal
approach;
a
violent
revolution,
sweeping
away
all
existing
institutions,
was
in
his
view
the
necessary
prelude
to
the
construction
of
a
free
and
peaceful
society.

the
individualism
and
nonviolence
implicit
in
Proudhon’s
vision
