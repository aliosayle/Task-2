not
only
that
the
means
of
production
should
be
owned
cooperatively
but
that
there
should
be
complete
communism
in
terms
of
distribution.
This
theory
revived
the
scheme
described
in
Sir
Thomas
More’s
Utopia
(1516),
involving
common
storehouses
from
which
everyone
would
be
allowed
to
take
whatever
he
wished
on
the
basis
of
the
formula
“From
each
according
to
his
means,
to
each
according
to
his
needs.”
In
The
Conquest
of
Bread
(1892),
Kropotkin
sketched
a
vision
of
a
revolutionary
society
organized
as
a
federation
of
free
communist
groups.
He
reinforced
this
vision
in
Mutual
Aid:
A
Factor
in
Evolution
(1902),
