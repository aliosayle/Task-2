property
of
society,
and
be
managed
in
common
by
the
producers
of
wealth.
And
in
common
with
the
most
advanced
representatives
of
political
radicalism,
they
maintain
that
the
ideal
of
the
political
organization
of
society
is
a
condition
of
things
where
the
functions
of
government
are
reduced
to
a
minimum,
and
the
individual
recovers
his
full
liberty
of
initiative
and
action
for
satisfying,
by
means
of
free
groups
and
federations--freely
constituted--all
the
infinitely
varied
needs
of
the
human
being.
As
regards
socialism,
most
of
the
anarchists
arrive
at
its
ultimate
conclusion,
that
is,
at
a
complete
negation
of
the
wage-system
