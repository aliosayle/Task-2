i'll
think
about
wording.
i'm
happy
with
something
like
that
in
there
since
it's
a
view
a
lot
of
anarchist
communists
have,
i
just
don't
think
it
should
be
presented
as
uncontroversial
fact.
but
out
of
interest
which
anarcho-syndicalists
want
"economic
relations
based
on
reward
of
effort
and
exchange"?
i
mean,
there
may
well
be
self-identified
individuals
with
such
views,
and
i
guess
if
your
anarchism
was
mutualist
and
you
pursued
a
syndicalist
strategy
that
would
be
a
form
of
anarcho-syndicalism.
but
is
there
any
significant
tendency
that
does
that?
