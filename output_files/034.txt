dominated
mainstream
anarchism
from

the
destruction
of
anarchism
as

mass
movement
at

of
the
Spanish
Civil
War

1939.
The
First
International
was

the
contradictory
personalities
of

as
in
their
rival
doctrines—revolution
by
a
disciplined
party
versus
revolution
by
the
spontaneous
insurgence
of
the
working
class,
respectively.
