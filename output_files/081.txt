after
the
Chinese
Revolution
(1911–12).
Chinese
anarchists
educated
in
Paris
(the
so-called
“Paris
anarchists”)
returned
to
Beijing
and
immediately
became
involved
in
the
reform
of
education
and
culture.
Convinced
of
the
need
for
social
revolution,
the
Paris
anarchists
argued
in
favour
of
Western
science
against
religion
and
superstition,
called
for
the
emancipation
of
women
and
youth,
rejected
the
traditional
family
and
the
Confucian
values
on
which
it
was
based,
and
organized
experimental
work-study
communities
as
alternatives
to
traditional
forms
of
family
and
working
life.
These
ideas
and
practices
were
extremely
influential
in
the
New
Culture
movement
of
the
late
1910s
