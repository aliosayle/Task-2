artistic
figures
as
precursors
and
allies.
In
an
influential
essay,
“Anarchism
in
Literature”
(published
posthumously
in
1914),
the
American
anarchist
poet
Voltairine
de
Cleyre
identified
anarchist
sensibilities
in
writers
and
philosophers
as
diverse
as
François
Rabelais,
Jean-Jacques
Rousseau,
and
Émile
Zola
in
France;
Ralph
Waldo
Emerson,
Henry
David
Thoreau,
and
Walt
Whitman
in
the
United
States;
Friedrich
Nietzsche
in
Germany;
and
Leo
Tolstoy
in
Russia.
Many
of
the
central
figures
of
early
20th-century
anarchism
were
passionately
interested
in
the
arts.
Several
of
them
wrote
extensively
on
artistic
themes,
including
Peter
Kropotkin,
Emma
Goldman,
Gustav
Landauer,
and
Camillo
Berneri.
