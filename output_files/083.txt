His
polemical
exchanges
with
the
socialist
leader
Jiang
Khangu
helped
to
popularize
anarchism
as
a
“pure
socialism”
and
to
distinguish
it
from
other
currents
in
socialist
thought.

in
Vietnam
and
Korea
Anarchist
ideas
entered
Vietnam
through
the
activities
of
the
early
Vietnamese
nationalist
leader
Phan
Boi
Chau.
Phan,
who
led
the
struggle
against
French
colonial
rule
during
the
first
two
decades
of
the
20th
century,
was
introduced
to
anarchism
by
Chinese
intellectuals
in
Tokyo
in
1905–09.
Although
Phan
was
not
an
anarchist
himself,
his
thinking
reflected
certain
distinctly
anarchist
themes,
notably
anti-imperialism
and
“direct
action.”
