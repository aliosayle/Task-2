don't
want
to
edit
this
unilaterally
as
it's
attributed
to
the
AF,
but
this
seems
manifestly
incorrect:
In
general
anarchist
communists
of
all
kinds
are
critical
of
some
aspects
of
anarcho-syndicalism
which
considers
workplace
self-management
by
workers
as
fundamental
to
the
aims
(as
well
as
the
means)
of
achieving
social
revolution
and
still
maintains
economic
relations
based
on
reward
of
effort
and
exchange.
historically
most
anarchist
communists
have
been
anarcho-syndicalists
(critically
or
otherwise),
and
anarcho-syndicalism
is
committed
to
libertarian
communism,
not
'economic
relations
based
on
reward
of
effort
and
exchange'.
