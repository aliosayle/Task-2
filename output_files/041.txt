the
writers
Paul
Adam,
Octave
Mirbeau,
Laurent
Tailhade,
and
Felix
Fénéon.
The
Symbolist
poet
Stéphane
Mallarmé
was
also
a
strong
sympathizer.
In
England,
the
Irish
poet
and
dramatist
Oscar
Wilde
declared
himself
an
anarchist
and,
under
Kropotkin’s
inspiration,
wrote
the
essay
“The
Soul
of
Man
Under
Socialism”
(1891).
Artists
were
attracted
by
the
individualist
spirit
of
anarchism.
By
the
mid-1890s,
however,
the
more
militant
anarchists
in
France
began
to
realize
that
an
excess
of
individualism
had
detached
them
from
the
workers
they
sought
to
liberate.
Anarchists,
indeed,
have
always
found
it
difficult
to
reconcile
the
claims
of
general
human
solidarity
