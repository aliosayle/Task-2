Emma

United
States.
In
different
ways
they
argued
that
the
state
and
private
property
are
interdependent
institutions:
the
state
exists
to
protect
private
property,
and
the
owners
of
private
property
protect
the
state.
If
property
is
to
be
owned
communally
and
distributed
equally,
the
state
must
be
smashed
once
and
for
all.
In
Statism
and
Anarchy
(1874),
for
example,
Bakunin
attacked
Marx’s
view
that
the
transitional
state—the
dictatorship
of
the
proletariat—would
simply
wither
away
after
it
had
served
its
purpose
of
preventing
a
bourgeois
counterrevolution.
No
state,
said
Bakunin,
has
ever
withered
away,
and
no
state
ever
