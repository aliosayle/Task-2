others
repudiated
violence
in
favour
of
peaceful
means,
especially
education.
Nevertheless,
they
all
believed
that
politics
is
determined
mainly
by
society
and
culture

therefore
that
society

Anarchism
in
Japan
The
first
self-described
anarchist
in
East
Asia
was
the
Japanese
writer
and
activist
Kotoku
Shusui.
In
1901
Kotoku,
an
early
advocate
of
Japanese
socialism,
helped
to
found
the
Social
Democratic
Party,
which
was
immediately
banned
by
the
government.
Early
in
1905,
after
the
newspaper
he
published,
the
Heimin
shimbun
(“Commoner’s
Newspaper”),
denounced
the
Russo-Japanese
War,
the
paper
was
closed
