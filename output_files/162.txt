But
i'm
still
highly
sympathetic
to
AC,
as
it
holds
essentially
the
same
practical
views,
despite
arriving
at
them
by
a
different
route!
Anarchism,
the
no-government
system
of
socialism,
has
a
double
origin.
It
is
an
outgrowth
of
the
two
great
movements
of
thought
in
the
economic
and
the
political
fields
which
characterize
the
nineteenth
century,
and
especially
its
second
part.
In
common
with
all
socialists,
the
anarchists
hold
that
the
private
ownership
of
land,
capital,
and
machinery
has
had
its
time;
that
it
is
condemned
to
disappear;
and
that
all
requisites
for
production
must,
and
will,
become
the
common
