a
powerful
government,
much
more
powerful
than
all
those
of
our
own
times.
The
present
wage--system
has
grown
up
from
the
appropriation
of
the
necessaries
for
production
by
the
few;
it
was
a
necessary
condition
for
the
growth
of
the
present
capitalist
production,,
and
it
cannot
outlive
it,
even
if
an
attempt
be
made
to
pay
to
the
worker
the
full
value
of
his
produce,
and
hours-of
labor-checks
be
substituted
for
money.
Common
possession
of
the
necessaries
for
production
implies
the
common
enjoyment
of
the
fruits
of
the
common
production;
and
we
consider
that
an
equitable
organization
of
society
