1907.
Solidaridad
Obrera
quickly
spread
throughout
Catalonia,
and,
in
1909,
when
the
Spanish
army
tried
to
conscript
Catalan
reservists
to
fight
against
the
Riffs
in
Morocco,
it
called
a
general
strike.
The
work
was
followed
by
a
week
of
largely
spontaneous
violence
(“La
Semana
Tragica,”
or
the
Tragic
Week)
that
left
hundreds
dead
and
50
churches
and
monasteries
destroyed
and
that
ended
in
brutal
repression.
The
torture
of
anarchists
in
the
fortress
of
Montjuich
and
the
execution
of
the
internationally
celebrated
advocate
of
free
education
Francisco
Ferrer
led
to
worldwide
protests
and
the
resignation
of
the
conservative
government
in
Madrid.
