Contemporary
anarchism
After
World
War
II,
anarchist
groups
and
federations
reemerged
in
almost
all
countries
where
they
had
formerly
flourished—the
notable
exceptions
being
Spain
and
the
Soviet
Union—but
these
organizations
wielded
little
influence
compared
to
that
of
the
broader
movement
inspired
by
earlier
ideas.
This
development
is
not
surprising,
since
anarchists
never
stressed
the
need
for
organizational
continuity,
and
the
cluster
of
social
and
moral
ideas
that
are
identifiable
as
anarchism
always
spread
beyond
any
clearly
definable
movement.
