periodicals
published
original
poetry
and
art,
and
many
of
them
made
culture
and
the
arts
their
primary
focus.
The
most
widely
circulated
English-language
anarchist
magazine
of
the
1960s,
Anarchy,
devoted
entire
issues
to
poetry,
science
fiction,
blues,
theatre,
and
film.
From
the
time
of
Proudhon
through
the
1950s,
most
anarchists
favoured
a
propagandistic
style
of
art
that
treated
themes
of
social
protest,
and
they
generally
avoided
art
that
was
self-consciously
abstract,
inward
looking,
fantastic,
or
nihilistic,
as
was
much
of
Modernist
art
during
this
period.
Nevertheless,
many
Modernist
artists
participated
in
anarchist
groups
or
aided
anarchist
causes.
