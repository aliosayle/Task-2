basis
for

tyranny.”
In
The
Political
Capability
of
the
Working
Classes—his
final,
posthumously
published
work—Proudhon
argued
that
liberation
was
the
task
of
the
workers
themselves.
He
thereby
laid
the
intellectual
foundations
of
a
movement
that
rejected
democratic
and
parliamentary
politics
in
favour
of
various
forms
of
direct
action.
In
the
1860s
Proudhon’s
working-class
followers,
unlike
Proudhon
himself,
did
not
accept
the
name
anarchist;
instead,
they
preferred
to
call
themselves
Mutualists,
after
a
working-class
secret
society
to
which
Proudhon
had
belonged
in
Lyons
during
the
1830s.
In
1864,
shortly
before
Proudhon’s
death,
a
group
of
Mutualists
joined
with
British
trade
