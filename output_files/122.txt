power
over
men;
whoever
governs
production
also
governs
the
producers;
who
determines
consumption
is
master
over
the
consumer.
This
is
the
question;
either
things
are
administered
on
the
basis
of
free
agreement
among
the
interested
parties,
and
this
is
anarchy;
or
they
are
administered
according
to
laws
made
by
administrators
and
this
is
government,
it
is
the
State,
and
inevitably
it
turns
out
to
be
tyrannical.
It
is
not
a
question
of
the
good
intentions
or
the
good
will
of
this
or
that
man,
but
of
the
inevitability
of
the
situation,
and
of
the
tendencies
which
man
generally
develops
in
