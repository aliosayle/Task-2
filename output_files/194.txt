into
a
discussion
as
to
how
far
the
exchange
value
of
each
merchandise
is
really
measured
now
by
the
amount
of
labor
necessary
for
its
production--a
separate
study
must
be
devoted
to
the
subject--we
must
say
that
the
collectivist
ideal
seems
to
us
merely
unrealizable
in
a
society
which
has
been
brought
to
consider
the
necessaries
for
production
as
a
common
property.
Such
a
society
would
be
compelled
to
abandon
the
wage-system
altogether.
It
appears
impossible
that
the
mitigated
individualism
of
the
collectivist
school
could
co-exist
with
the
partial
communism
implied
by
holding
land
and
machinery
in
common-
unless
imposed
