1862

as
an
army
officer
in
Siberia,
where,
apart
from
his
military
duties,
he
studied
animal
life
and
engaged
in
geographic
exploration.
On
the
basis
of
his
observations,
he
elaborated
a
theory
of
the
structural
lines
of
mountain
ranges
that
revised
the
cartography
of
eastern
Asia.
He
also
contributed
to
knowledge
of
the
glaciation
of
Asia
and
Europe
during
the
Ice
Age.
Kropotkinâ€™s
findings
won
him
immediate
recognition
and
opened
the
way
to
a
distinguished
scientific
career.
But
in
1871
he
refused
the
secretaryship
of
the
Russian
Geographical
Society
and,
renouncing
his
aristocratic
heritage,
dedicated
his
life
