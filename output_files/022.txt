Winstanley
was
not
only
the
pioneer
theorist
of
anarchism
but
also
the
forerunner
of
anarchist
activism.
In
1649,
calling
upon
the
people
“to
manure
and
work
upon
the
common
lands,”
he
and
a
band
of
followers
occupied
a
hillside
in
southern
England
and
established
a
society
of
agrarian
free
communism.
