the
United
States
at
the
turn
of
the
century.
Goldman,
who
had
immigrated
to
the
United
States
from
tsarist
Russia
in
1885,
soon
became
a
preeminent
figure
in
the
American
anarchist
movement.
A
follower
of
Kropotkin,
she
lectured
widely
and
published
numerous
essays
on
anarchist
theory
and
practice
in
her
journal
Mother
Earth.
Most
of
her
campaigns
were
controversial.
She
argued
on
behalf
of
birth
control,
defended
the
bomb
throwers
of
her
era
as
victims
of
a
ruthless
capitalist
system,
opposed
women’s
suffrage—because,
in
her
view,
it
would
only
further
bind
women
to
bourgeois
reformism—and
spoke
out
against
American
entry
