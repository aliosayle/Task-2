was
ever
created,
even
though
by
the
end
of
the
19th
century
the
anarchist
movement
had
spread
to
all
continents
and
was
united
by
informal
links
of
correspondence
and
friendship
between
leading
figures.
National
federations
were
weak
even
in
countries
where
there
were
many
anarchists,
such
as
France
and
Italy,
and
the
typical
unit
of
organization
remained
the
small
group
dedicated
to
propaganda
by
deed
or
word.
Such
groups
engaged
in
a
wide
variety
of
activities;
in
the
1890s
many
of
them
set
up
experimental
schools
and
communities
in
an
attempt
to
live
according
to
anarchist
principles.
