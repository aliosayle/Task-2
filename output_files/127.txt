the
greatest
possibilities
of
success.
But
that
element
of
doubt,
which
always
remains
in
the
human
spirit
when
it
is
a
question
of
historical
prediction,
and
which
is
like
a
door
which
has
been
left
open
in
the
human
brain
to
receive
new
truths,
must
make
us
more
tolerant
and
more
disposed
to
be
cordially
sympathetic
towards
those
who
seek
the
same
goals
but
by
other
roads,
without,
however,
paralyzing
our
action
or
preventing
us
from
choosing
our
way
and
following
it
resolutely.
The
basic
characteristic
of
socialism
is
its
equal
application
to
all
members
of
society.
For
this
reason
