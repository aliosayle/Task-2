freedom
and
of
respecting
for
all
human
beings
the
dignity
that
they
expect,
or
should
expect,
from
others.
If
one
speaks
to
them
of
freedom
they
immediately
accuse
one
of
wanting
to
respect,
or
at
least
tolerate,
the
freedom
to
oppress
and
exploit
one’s
fellow
beings.
And
if
you
say
that
you
reject
violence
when
it
exceeds
the
limits
imposed
by
the
needs
of
defense,
they
accuse
you
of
…
pacifism,
without
understanding
that
violence
is
the
whole
essence
of
authoritarianism,
just
as
the
repudiation
of
violence
is
the
whole
essence
of
anarchism.[172]
Monarchy
is
the
most
suitable
political
form
